 Hi, I'm Niki in the pharmacist.
How can I help you?
Oh, hi.
I've got a new prescription.
Okay, great.
Thank you.
Would you please have a seat and we can discuss this further?
Thank you.
Is this prescription for yourself?
Yes, it is.
Okay.
And is it okay if I call you Miss York?
Yes, that's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
And have you been to our pharmacy before?
No, I haven't.
This is the first time.
Okay.
So if you don't mind before we get into the prescription, I'm just going to ask you a few questions.
Yes.
Do you have any allergies?
Not that I'm aware of.
No allergies, okay.
And do you have any medical conditions?
I've got pionary arterial hypertension.
Oh, okay.
They have high blood pressure in your lungs.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
And are you taking any medications?
Yes, I'm taking two actually.
I have to write them down.
One is dejocsin.
And the other is dill-tyson.
Okay.
So you take dejocsin and dill-tyson?
Yes.
Great.
And do you currently know the doses of those by any chance of the dill-tyson?
No, I can't remember.
But the doctor said I was taking quite a high dose and it wasn't really having any effect.
I see.
Okay.
And are you taking anything over the counter?
Like adveil or tylenol?
No.
No.
No.
Okay.
And do you take any vitamins or herbal supplements?
No, nothing.
Nothing like that.
Okay.
Do the doctor tell you about this medication he prescribed for you called Revecio?
Did he tell you what to expect from it or why he was prescribing this for you?
Well, I went to see him because I got an increased shortness of breath actually.
Okay.
And he said that the current medication I had really wasn't working.
So I want to try something different.
I see.
Okay.
And did he tell you anything specifically about the medication he prescribed the Revecio?
Not really.
I think he was expecting that from the pharmacist.
Okay.
Okay.
No problem.
So I'm just going to look over this and then we can talk a little bit more about this meditation your doctor has prescribed for you.
Right.
Okay.
So the medication the doctor prescribed for you is known as Revecio.
It contains an ingredient called saldenafil.
That's the chemical name.
And it's also a similar medication that's used for Viagra or for erectile dysfunction.
I heard that.
Yeah.
Somebody told me that.
Yeah.
You may have heard that.
So even though it contains a similar ingredient, in your case, the Revecio is used specifically for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Okay.
So it's perfectly fine for you to use.
And the dose is 20 milligrams.
And you're going to take that three times a day.
Three times.
And it's recommended to take it about six to eight hours apart.
And you can take that with or without food.
One important thing is it's important that you don't take it with grapefruit juice.
So I don't know if you have grapefruit juice.
Okay.
So you should avoid that because it can lead to increased levels of this medication in your body.
And you can experience increased side effects.
So we don't want that to happen.
So with this medication, again, you're going to take it one tablet three times a day.
And I just wanted to tell you about some side effects that you could possibly experience.
Yeah.
There's a few serious ones that I just want to warn you about that are rare.
But if you should ever experience this, then you should stop taking it and see your doctor immediately.
So if you ever notice any severe skin reaction like blistering or peeling or any pains, then in that case, you should stop taking it and go see your doctor immediately.
There's some other side effects you may or may not experience again.
Some of them involve feeling flu-like symptoms.
Some people have complained of a little bit of difficulty hearing or some vision disturbances.
So there's just some things to consider.
Again, they're rare, but I just want to make you aware of them.
And some of the more general side effects are things like headache and nausea that you might experience with this medication.
So with this medication, it's very important that you take it as prescribed.
And hopefully this medication will help your condition, which is known as the high blood pressure in your lungs.
So what it does is it targets the vessels between your heart and your lungs and it helps widen them.
So hopefully you'll be able to have better sensation of breathing and you won't have as much shortness of breath and doing your daily activities.
Great.
So do you have any questions for me about anything or...?
No, I was going to ask about what you've already mentioned, was the Viagra part.
It's okay for women to take this medication.
Yeah, it's a good concern.
And as I mentioned, Ravecio is used for high blood pressure in the lungs and the chemical ingredient is also used for rectile dysfunction.
And in your case, this medication is for the high blood pressure in your lungs.
Okay.
That's fine.
Okay.
Great.
Well, if you have any additional questions, please feel free to call us.
Yes, I will.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
